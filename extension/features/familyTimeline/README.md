This produces a family timeline, including all the events (birth, marriage, and death) of all the profile person's immediate family, which means it starts before they were born (with their parents' birth) and ends after they died (with their children's deaths).  

The link for the Family Timeline is among the links below the tabs on a profile page.

It uses jQuery UI to make the table draggable.  

The table can be closed by clicking the 'X' in the top right of the pop-up div or by double-clicking the table/div.

We need to find ways to get more timeline data from the biographies.
